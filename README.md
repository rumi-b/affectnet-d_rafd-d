# AffectNet-D and RaFD-D

AffectNet-D and RaFD-D are datasets that contain depthmaps for a subset of AffectNet (~88K) and RaFD (~4K) images. 
AffectNet is a large-scale in-the-wild face dataset that consists of 8 different expressions as well as valence and arousal annotations. 
Similarly, RaFD provides a dataset that contains facial expression in a controlled environment.
